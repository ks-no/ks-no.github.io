## Reporting a Vulnerability

We strongly encourage you to report any security vulnerabilities you might find in our software to our private security mailing list: fiks-sikkerhet@ks.no - first, before disclosing them in any public forums of any kind.

This is a private mailing list where only members of the KS-Fiks security team are subscribed to, and your report will be treated as top priority.
